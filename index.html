					My 20 Time Project: Building a Website
				</h1>

				<p class="containerText">
                    For my personal 20 Time Project, I decided to revisit something that I haven't done in a while. Web Design was a class I took in 2019, and I first learned about it in 2016, my freshman year of high school. As a senior I've learned much more than "Hello World!" and this is my showcase of that ability. I want this site to not only represent my 2020 CSIP Class at CCM, but also give insight on the program to high school freshmen and sophomores interested in CSIP. This site will show what I started with before this program to where I am now, and will talk about the unique experiences that my classmates and I have shared.

                	What is CSIP?
                </h1>

                <p class="containerText">
                	Cyber Security and Information Protection or CSIP is the base for computer and network protection from cyber crime. Cyber crime is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world, and to counter-act it, cyber security is rapidly growing as well. Combined, MCVTS's CSIP Share-Time Program and CCM's Cybersecurity Center of Excellence provides a unique dual-enrollment experience for high school juniors and seniors who want to learn more about the field.

				<ul class="containerText">

					<li class="containerText">
						<b> Password Encryption </b>
						<ul class="containerText">
							<li>
								In order to keep our information safe, we need strong passwords,
								which is, although very simple, a vital part to cyber security.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="containerText">
						<b> Network Security </b>
						<ul class="containerText">
							<li>
								To prevent malicious attacks on our networks we use everyday,
								methods of cyber security are used to protect them.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="containerText">
						<b> Application Security </b>
						<ul class="containerText">
							<li>
								Similar to network security, cyber security methods are applied
								in applications to ensure that threats cannot take the information
								attackers are looking for.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
