           	 		My Professors have been a vital part to my success and learning experience in CSIP and at CCM. Without their flexibility, yet sternness, I would not be as prepared for college. The experience and opportunity they provided for me has allowed me to succeed and move forward as a student and adult.

					Although I had you for only a single class, I want to thank you for being my teachers in my senior year. I am extremely grateful that all of you come from extremely different backgrounds, as it has allowed me to understand different perspectives in the fields that I am extremely passionate about.

					Though I had you for only one winter online class, I want to thank you for putting the time and effort for us high school students, providing the opportunity of CSIP at CCM. Without this opportunity, I would not have grown a deeper interest for cyber security and I would not have had as impressive of a resume as I do now.

					Professor Agar

				<p class="containerText">
					Professor Agar, you've been a great influence on me with the amount of flexibility and guidance you gave me. When I read your letter of reccomendation for me, I was very proud of myself, which helped my self esteem as well. I cannot thank you enough for being my professor throughout senior year, as you made it a great year for me.

					Professor Rywalt

					Every CSIP student, no matter where they are today, cannot express their gratitude for you in words. To me, you are much more than a professor. Rather, you are a guider, an influence, and a model for us CSIP students. The amount of effort you put into CSIP is unbelieveable, and we cannot thank you enough for your patience, guidance, flexibility, strictness, and passion for the program.

					I personally think high school teachers and school staff in general are underappreciated. The amount of effort and work they put in for the success of their students is unbelievable, and I cannot be more grateful for them.

					In my sophomore year when I first had you, I found that you were one of the most easy going, flexible, and resourceful teachers I've ever had. Since then, if I asked for advice, a favor, or even a math lesson when I wasn't in your class, you would never say no. 

					<br><br>

					p.s.<br>Thank you for letting me hang out in your class whenever I had no where to go during academic period :)

					Mr. Feinsinger 
				</h3>

				<p class="containerText">
					Since my freshman year, you have been my favorite teacher. At first it was unexplainable why, but as I got older I began to appreciate your ability to connect with students on a personal level, but also nurture them into mature, hard working students. When people ask me, "What teachers should I look forward to having in high school?", my immediate answer is you. Thank you for your influence on me. I originally wanted to study forensics but you helped guide me to make a better choice for myself, even with your passion for the forensic field.

				</h3>

				<p class="containerText">
					Thank you for pushing me to work hard during my senior year. I started developing senioritis but you really made it clear to me that my education is no where near over, and senior year is just the beginning of adulthood. The amount of effort and time I put into this project was not just for a grade; You made me realize that it was for me, and that it is a project to showcase how far I've grown since my freshman year. Small things like your flexability with Membean and the Christmas card you sent me will stay with me for a very long time, and I will remember to credit you if I make any 20 Time-like project again.
