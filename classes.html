                    This page talks about each class CSIP students took from 2018-2020, which has changed for other generations of CSIP students. Most classes during the first year are IT related, but were more cyber security focused in the second year.

                                In Intro to IT, we were taught the basics of IT, from BIOS/UEFI
                                to the internals of a hard drive. We took apart and put back together
                                computers in the lab, and we were even able to fix some that were 
                                broken. Intro to IT was a very hands-on class and taught us how to
                                properly handle a computer.

                                Operating Systems was much more than learning about the surface of Windows.
                                In OS, we were taught about Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Unix. With hands-on 
                                labs using a virtual machine, we learned about command line, OS functions, 
                                and much more.

                                In Computer Science I, or what we called "Java", we learned the basics of 
                                the programming language Java, hence the nickname. We learned how to use 
                                basic Java packages and libraries, such as java.util, java.lang, and javax.swing.
                                By writing programs for calculators, games, and much more, we were able to write 
                                a Java program of our own by the end of the semester.

                                In Foundations of Info Security, or "Security" for short, we learned 
                                about methods of cyber attacks, encryption methods, and much more on 
                                the basics of cybersecurity. We learned to identify a type of attack,
                                and leanred how to use ans efficient method to counter it.

                                Visual Basic, also known as VB or VB.net, uses Microsoft's Visual Studio

                                how to make basic Windows applications as well as web applications, and 
                                got an introduction to graphical design when it came to user interfaces.

                                Web Design is focused around, well, designing webpages. We learned how to

                                This project is actually from this class, and the skills we learned from it are

                                In routing, we were taught how networks communicate with one another via different mediums, devices, and more. We learned how to use CISCO IOS and Packet Tracer, as well as calculate binary and its meaning in a network and submask.

                                Network security was one step up from Foundations of Info Security. We learned about threat actors, attack methods, responses to attacks, and essentials in cyber security. It helped prepare us for future classes that we would take later in the year and in college, as some students decided to study cyber security or related fields.

                                Linux is exactly what it sounds like, but much more. At first, we learned the basics of Linux, how to use it, who made it, when it was made, and about different distributions of it. As the semester progressed, however, we began learning about scripting and began writing scripts of our own, allowing automated control of a Linux system.

                                Ethical hacking was a very different class compared to the other ones. Understanding attacks, vulnerabilities, and methods to counteract attacks were almost everyday practices within the class.
